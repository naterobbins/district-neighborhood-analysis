<p>Before residential subdivisions and businesses were formed in this area in the 1950s, this portion of Austin was primarily used for farming and the grazing of dairy cattle and was considered the ‘country’. A partial remainder of one of these farm homesteads is still located on Joseph Clayton Drive, just south of E. Braker Lane. This particular area of Austin was formerly a part of the town of Fiskville, Texas, with the center of town being located on North Lamar Boulevard.

It was during one of Austin’s boom periods in the 1960s and 1970s that residential and commercial developers started buying the remaining dairy farms, small homesteads and swaths of vacant land in this area of Austin. Residential subdivisions were built to house families working for government offices and the University of Texas. Up until the 1950s, everything northeast of US 81/183, was located outside the city limits. It was not until December 2008 that the entire northern portion of the Windsor Hills Neighborhood NPA was fully annexed into the City of Austin.

By the 1970s, most of the Windsor Hills neighborhood residential area was subdivided and built out, consisting mostly of one story ranch houses, constructed out of brick or native limestone with two car garages. To this day, the Windsor Hills neighborhood is dominated by single family houses. Over 60% of the Windsor Hills neighborhood is made up of single family houses. In the neighborhood, residents cherish the large mature trees, quiet streets, and the quick and easy access to the downtown.
