Before residential subdivisions and businesses began moving into this area in the 1950s, this portion of Austin was primarily used for farming and the grazing of dairy cattle and was considered the ‘country’. A partial remainder of one of these farm homesteads is still located on Joseph Clayton Drive, just south of E. Braker Lane. This particular area of Austin was formerly a part of the town of Fiskville, Texas, with the
center of town being located on North Lamar Boulevard.

It was during one of Austin’s boom periods in the 1960s and 1970s that residential and commercial developers started buying the remaining dairy farms, small homesteads and swaths of vacant land in this area of Austin. Residential subdivisions were built to house families working for the city, state and federal government, and the University of Texas. Up until the 1950s, everything northeast of US 81/183, was located outside the city limits. It was not until December 2008 that the entire northern portion of the Windsor Hills Neighborhood NPA was fully annexed into the City of Austin.
