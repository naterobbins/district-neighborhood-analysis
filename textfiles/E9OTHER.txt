The main focus of City and neighborhood efforts is to retain the historical and cultural identity of the E5 while encouraging new development. The neighborhood plan attempts to preserve the traditional neighborhood character while encouraging walkability and connectivity to surrounding commercial districts.

Interest in reconnecting East Fifth and Sixth streets to downtown has brought entertainment across the highway and opened new opportunities for locally owned restaurants and music venues, housing, and commercial properties. Other efforts to reconnect East Austin include a MetroRail stop at Plaza Saltillo, several B-Cycle community bicycle stations, designation of 11th street as a gateway to East Austin and improvements to pedestrian walkways. The City's Imagine Austin comprehensive plan designates Seventh Street as a Neighborhood Center where City and community efforts focus on creating an area that is walkable, bikable, and supported by transit.

Future development is governed by several small area plans, including the neighborhood plan, the Plaza Saltillo Station Area Plan and Regulating Plan, two Neighborhood Conservation Combining Districts, and Subchapters E and F. All of these efforts work together in an effort to improve the development quality of the rapidly changing East Austin neighborhoods and to help ensure a cohesive development pattern throughout the neighborhoods.
