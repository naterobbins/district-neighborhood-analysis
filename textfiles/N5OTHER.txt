St. John's and Coronado Hills

Like Georgian Acres, the St. John and Coronado Hills area is a relatively young community. A large percent of the population (41%) is between the ages of 15 to 34. As well, 20.4% of the population is under nine years of age. The 55 and over age group represents 11% of the population, adding an older demographic to the community’s mix. Persons of Hispanic origin make up the majority of the population and steadily increased between 2000 and 2010. At 70% of the population, the growth in this particular ethnicity supports the SJCHCNPA community’s position as a popular “immigrant gateway” community. Based on the 2010 census, whites comprise 14.3% of the area's population, while 15.6% is African-American.
