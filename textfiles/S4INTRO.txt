The South Manchaca area was the first area to develop with single-family homes in the 1950s. One of the first suburban developments in the Westgate area was the Western Trails subdivision, built in 1956. Besides the Western Trails subdivision, there was limited residential development in the Westgate and Garrison Park neighborhoods in the early 1960s.

However, by the end of the 1960s, development had spread throughout the Westgate area and down into the Garrison Park area along Manchaca Road. When Crockett High School was opened in 1968 at the intersection of Manchaca Road and Stassney Lane, the only other development in the area was a two-story farmhouse on Manchaca Road. By the 1980s, most of the present day residential and commercial development in the area had occurred.
