<p>The Westgate and Garrison Park neighborhoods comprise District S4. These were included in the South Austin Combined Neighborhood Plan
</p><p>
One of the first suburban developments in the Westgate area was the Western Trails subdivision, built in 1956. Besides the Western Trails subdivision, there was limited residential development in the Westgate and Garrison Park neighborhoods in the early 1960s.
</p><p>
By the end of the 1960s, development had spread throughout the Westgate area and into the Garrison Park area along Manchaca Road. When Crockett High School opened in 1968 at the intersection of Manchaca Road and Stassney Lane, the only other development in the area was a two-story farmhouse on Manchaca Road. By the 1980s, most of the present day residential and commercial development in the area had occurred.

The district is largely residential and also includes commercial, office, civic, hospital, and park land uses. Single-family houses are the predominant housing type in this district, followed by multifamily housing and duplexes. Around half of the total housing units throughout the district are owner occupied, with the Westgate planning area having the lowest rate at 38.2% and the South Manchaca planning area having the highest, at 56.8%.

Bike lanes are installed on some streets such as include Stassney Lane, Berkeley Avenue, and Emerald Forest Drive, but not on others such as Westgate Boulevard, William Cannon Drive, South 1st, and Manchaca Rd. The sidewalk network is also largely complete along major roadways; however, along residential streets there are sidewalks on only one side of the street, significant gaps in the sidewalk network, and on many residential streets there are no sidewalks. Existing resources within the South Austin Combined Neighborhood Planning Area include Garrison District Park, Armadillo Park, four City parks associated with elementary schools, and the greenbelt along portions of Williamson Creek. According to an analysis conducted in 2010, 34% of the district is covered by tree canopy. This is above the citywide average of 31%.

According to a survey conducted at the April 2013 Crime and Code Enforcement Meeting, the greatest concerns associated with safety in the district are speeding and robbery, while the top code compliance concerns are housing in substandard condition, and junk and accumulated rubbish. In 2012-2015, property-abatement cases dominated the neighborhood workload. Property-abatement also led cases in multifamily, closely followed by structure-condition complaints. Commercial officers handled a mix of structure-condition violations, land-use violations, and property-abatement cases.
