The neighborhood district contains a significant amount of land for parks and recreation. The Williamson Creek Greenbelt runs from IH-35 to South Pleasant Valley Rd. East of that Greenbelt lies Roy Kizer Golf Course as well as McKinney Falls State Park.

The racial makeup of the district has been changing over the past few decades. White population has decreased, and Hispanics are now the majority in the district by a wide margin. Family households are far more common than non-family household in this district. Population density is highest in the west portion of the district near IH-35, and population density decreases as one heads east toward US 183.
