The ethnic makeup of this district is predominently white, but the percentage of whites is decreasing, and the percentage of Hispanics is increasing. Single-family housing in S8 took off in the 1970s, and has continued to grow in recent decades. The district is known for its natural beauty and environmental sensitivity, due to its mix of land forms, water features, and habitat, and its connection—via the Edwards Aquifer—to the Colorado River and Austin’s water supply. Water resources, critical environmental features, environmentally sensitive areas, and natural development constraints create layers of complexity that shape land development here. Water resources in the area include Williamson, Barton, and Slaughter creeks and the Edwards and Trinity Aquifers. The Edwards Aquifer is the most significant water feature in the area. Some parts of the district are not located within the city limits, but are within Austin’s extra territorial jurisdiction (ETJ). The ETJ is the unincorporated land within five miles of Austin’s boundary that is not within the city limits or the ETJ of another city. Austin alone is authorized to annex land from the ETJ. This enables the City to regulate adjacent land whose development can affect the quality of life within the city.
