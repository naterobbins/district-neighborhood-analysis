The diminutive NN3 district is characterized by well-established single family and duplex neighborhoods flanked by large multifamily housing units on the main arterials of Rundberg and Lamar, and industrial uses along Metric and Research Boulevard – which serves as the frontage road for US 183. Part of the district was once the independent district of Fiskville, which was annexed by Austin in the mid-1960s. With annexation came interim zoning regulation and a flurry of land use regulations that overlapped and led to sprawled growth throughout the region. 
As Austin expanded, homesteaders and small scale farms in the area sold their land to developers throughout the 1970s and 1980s resulting in the many office parks and subdivisions present today. Rapid highway construction has also affected the district—US183 was upgraded to highway standards in 2002 and Lamar serves as a key north south arterial for the city and increases speed and road grade further north. 
The single family neighborhoods within the district share similar issues: increasing tax appraisals, residents being forced out, and property neglect due to the high number of rental units. This region has not however experienced major population growth. 
Although this district is relatively safer than neighboring North 5, it is still part of the greater Restore Rundberg program, aimed at targeting crime, blight and neglect throughout North Austin. The program funds community building, safety programs and restoration efforts propelled by a large federal grant. Nevertheless, the NACA neighborhood plan envisions a safe, vibrant and economically strong community.
