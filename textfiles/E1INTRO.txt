<p>District E1 includes the southeast Austin neighborhood of Montopolis. The triangular district is bounded by Grove Blvd. on the east, 183 on the west, and Ben White Blvd. on the South. Its 2015 population estimate is 24,836 based on the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey. It has slightly more owner-occupied housing units than renter-occupied units.</p>

<p>Montopolis was originally settled as a separate community on the outskirts of Austin. The open fields that surrounded it helped preserve the identity of the area. The feeling of isolation in Montopolis is enhanced by the general street pattern. Vargas Rd. and Montopolis Dr. run the entire length of the neighborhood and offer the only obvious access to the area. The neighborhood retains the feeling of being in a distinct community with clear points of entry. Prior to annexation by the City, the subdivision of land was conducted informally. This resulted in lots of unwieldy shape and size in several areas, most notably between Montopolis Dr. and Vargas Rd. The pattern of areas subdivided after annexation tends to be much more like the remainder of the city. The eastern edge of the study area, contains a mix of single-family, industrial and commercial zoning.

Major parkland acquisitions along the Colorado River and the ACC Riverside campus form a partial buffer against intensive multi-family and commercial development along Pleasant Valley Rd. In contrast, no buffer exists between the Montopolis neighborhood and the growing industrial area along Ben White Blvd. Certain sites within Montopolis and adjacent areas along the freeways have the potential for non-residential development. As sites with direct access to the emerging freeway system become rare, however, other large undeveloped tracts may be considered as potential sites for non-residential development.

In district E1, the most common neighborhood complaints are property abatement complaints. For multifamily, structure condition complains lead, and Land-use violations comprise the majority of the commercial workload.</p>
