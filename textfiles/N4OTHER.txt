Property-abatement cases dominate the neighborhood workload in Distict N4, while structure-condition cases comprise the majority of multifamily. While land-use violations is the most common type of commercial case, N4 also sees a large number of property-abatement and structure-condition cases.

Development first began in the northern portion of the Windsor Hills NPA (starting in the 1950s in Windsor Hills), and gradually worked its way south, into the Heritage Hills NPA. To this day, the Windsor Hills NPA is dominated by single family houses, while the Heritage Hills NPA has a greater diversity of land uses, including single family houses, multifamily and mobile home residential uses, and industrial, office and commercial uses. And while over 60% of the Windsor Hills NPA is made up of single family houses, only 13% of Heritage Hills NPA consists of single family houses. The size, bulk, scale and design of the variety of houses in the HHWHCNPA contribute to the diverse character of each neighborhood. In the HHWHCNPA, residents cherish the large mature trees, quiet streets, and the quick and easy access to the downtown.

Between 1950s to 1970s, most of the Windsor Hills NPA residential area was subdivided and built out, consisting mostly of one story ranch houses, constructed out of brick or native limestone with two car garages.
