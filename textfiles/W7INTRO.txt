W7 is made up of the following neighborhoods:  Hyde Park, North Loop, and Rosedale. 

HYDE PARK - During the 1960s, the rapid growth of the University of Texas increased the demand for housing and rental property in the area. The decline of some of the neighborhoods older homes made it a prime target for demolition and removal, and building new apartment complexes. The Hyde Park Neighborhood Association was formed in 1974. 

NORTH LOOP - This  neighborhood that is approximately 5 miles north of the downtown area. Within the North Loop Neighborhood Planning Area there are three active Neighborhood Associations. These are Northfield, Morningside-Ridgetop, and Eye 35/Airport Blvd. The closure of the Robert Mueller Airport in 1999 not only increased the quality of life of neighborhood residents by eliminating noise and other impacts; but the closure has contributed to the North Loop area becoming a more attractive and sought after location. 

ROSEDALE - There are over 1200 homes in the area, a wide variety of businesses within easy walking distance, and an extensive network of medical services close at hand (including Seton Hospital). This neighborhood is primarily made up of single family homes, but the corridors along Burnet Road and N. Lamar Blvd are almost exclusively commercial.
