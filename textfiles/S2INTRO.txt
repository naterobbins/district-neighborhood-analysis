<p>In 1960, the City of Austin began construction on what would become the Ben White and US Highway 183 interchange. In that same decade, the Dove Springs and Franklin Park subdivisions were platted, with the bulk of the houses built in the 1970s. The areas around Peppertree Pkwy and Dove Springs Road were first to develop, with territories north of Teri Rd. following suit.

The city gradually annexed southeast Austin in a series of small annexations during the 1970s and 1980s. Also in the 1980s, the Southeast Corner Alliance of Neighbors (SCAN) formed to respond to growing crime and gang problems in the Dove Springs area. By the mid-1990s, residents of the greater Dove Springs area had organized their own targeted efforts. This helped reverse the trend of crime and gang violence and provided outlets for the abundant youth population. The neighbors also gained tools to help families purchase their homes and encourage better maintenance of properties throughout the Southeast area.

District S2 contains a significant amount of land for parks and recreation. The Williamson Creek Greenbelt runs from IH-35 to South Pleasant Valley Rd. East of that Greenbelt lies Roy Kizer Golf Course as well as McKinney Falls State Park.

The racial composition of the district has changed over the past few decades. White population has decreased, and Hispanics are now the majority in the district. Family households are far more common than non-family household in this district. Population density is highest in the west portion of the district near IH-35, and population density decreases east toward US 183.
