In 1960, the City of Austin began construction on what would be the Ben White and US Highway 183 interchange. In that same decade, the Dove Springs and Franklin Park subdivisions were platted, and they too saw gradual development, with the bulk of the houses built in the 1970s. The areas around Peppertree Pkwy and Dove Springs Road grew up first, with territories north of Teri Rd. following suit. 

The territory of Southeast Austin was annexed gradually in a series of small annexations throughout the 1970s and 1980s.Also in the 1980s, the Southeast Corner Alliance of Neighbors (SCAN) formed to respond to growing crime and gang problems in the Dove Springs area. By the mid-1990s, residents of the greater Dove Springs area had become extremely organized through their own targeted efforts and through the City Sponsored Self-Reliant Initiative. They reversed the trend of crime and gang violence and provided outlets for the abundant youth population. They also gained tools to help families purchase their homes and encourage better maintenance of properties throughout the Southeast area.
