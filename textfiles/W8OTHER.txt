HANCOCK- During the 1990s, the population of the Hancock Neighborhood Planning Area grew by a significant 15.5%. This increase is notable because few new noteworthy multi-family projects were developed during that time and most of the population increase was absorbed by the existing housing or by modest additions to the existing housing stock. 

NORTH UNIVERSITY - This neighborhood is predominently White, and Asians are the largest minority group in the neighborhood. However, Hispanic and Other populations are growing in the neighborhood. University of Texas students makeup the majority of this neighborhood. 

WEST UNIVERSITY - West Uiversity has an even higher concentration of UT students than Norht University. In the ten years between the 1990 and 2000 Census, the West University Neighborhood Planning Area experienced population growth of 10.6%. 

CENTRAL WEST AUSTIN - Central West Austin’s growth from 1990 to 2000 came largely through the addition of about 600 households, some of which was added when 256 units were added for The Gables at the Brackenridge Tract. During this time, the average size of households remained about the same. Central West Austin is less diverse than Austin as a whole. Around 80% of neighborhood residents are White. The middle-aged population in the neighborhood recently experienced signifacant growth. The substantial growth in those aged 45 to 54 suggests that middle-aged residents are staying; the decline in those aged 35 to 44 suggests that younger residents, though they live in the neighborhood in great numbers, are less prone to stay. Additionally, rising home prices could be driving younger residents out.
