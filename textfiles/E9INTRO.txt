The combined NE7 and NE9 districts contain some of Austin's oldest neighborhoods, with development dating back to the 1840s. There are two existing historic districts, Swede Hill National Register District and Willow-Spence Streets Historic District, as well as several individual historic landmarks in the area. In the early 1900s, the district's social, religious and entertainment establishments supported a culturally rich population. Neighborhoods east of East Avenue (now I-35) contained nearly the entire African American population in the 1920s, with Hispanic communities relocating to the area shortly after.

Effects of age and neglect surfaced along the district's corridors after the construction of I-35 separated East Austin from downtown in the 1950s and rail yards along Fifth Street were abandoned in the 1980s. Efforts to reestablish the neighborhoods gained momentum with several community and City initiatives including Operation Impact, a Neighborhood Conservation Combining District for East 11th and 12th Streets, a Master Plan for the Central East Austin area in 1996, and neighborhood plans for the East Cesar Chavez and Central East Austin neighborhoods.
