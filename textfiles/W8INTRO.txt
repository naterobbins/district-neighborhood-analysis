<p>District W8 includes these neighborhood planning areas:  Hancock, West University, North University, and Central West Austin.</p>

<h2>Hancock</h2>
<p>The primary destination in this neighborhood is the Hancock shopping center. The retail center provides services such as a supermarket, pet store, and department store for surrounding areas.</p>

<p>During the 1990s, the population of the Hancock Neighborhood Planning Area grew by a significant 15.5%. This increase is notable because few new noteworthy multi-family projects were developed during that time and most of the population increase was absorbed by the existing housing or by modest additions to the existing housing stock.</p>

<h2>West University</h2>
<p>In this student-heavy area, apartments and condominiums have been added in recent years to the housing mix (replacing many of the houses on San Gabriel Street, Leon Street, and Robbins Place).</p>

<h2>North University</h2>
<p>Although this neighborhood is largely single-family homes, garage apartments began appearing in the mid-1920s. Numerous two-story apartments were constructed during the last half of the twentieth century, eliminating the last of the undeveloped lots as well as some the older houses.</p>

<h2>Central West Austin</h2>
<p>Central West Austin is primarily urban with most development close to environmental features and, in some cases, within the flood plain. This is because the neighborhood developed before environmental regulations were enacted or enforced.</p>

<p>Central West Austin is less diverse than Austin as a whole. Around 80% of neighborhood residents are White. The middle-aged population in the neighborhood recently experienced significant growth. The substantial growth in those aged 45 to 54 suggests that middle-aged residents are staying; the decline in those aged 35 to 44 suggests that younger residents, though they live in the neighborhood in great numbers, are less prone to stay. Additionally, rising home prices could be driving younger residents out.</p>

<p>In 2012-2015, property-abatement cases were the majority of the neighborhood workload. Structure-condition violations were the most common type of case for multifamily, followed by property-abatement cases. While land-use violations led commercial, it also had significant numbers of property-abatement and structure-condition cases.</p>
