The W8 District is comprised of these neighborhood planning areas:  Hancock, West University, North University, and Central West Austin. HANCOCK - The main attraction in this neighborhood is The Hancock Shopping Center. It is a vibrant commercial
center that serves the needs of a significant cross-section of Austin residents. WEST UNIVERSITY - Apartments and condominiums have been
added to the housing mix (replacing many of the houses on San Gabriel Street,
Leon Street, and Robbins Place). NORTH UNIVERSITY - Garage apartments began appearing in the mid-1920s.
Numerous two-story apartments were constructed during the last half of the
twentieth century, eliminating the last of the undeveloped lots as well as some
the older houses. CENTRAL WEST AUSTIN - Central West Austin is primarily urban
with most development having occurred
before environmental regulations were
enforced. As a result, development has
occurred close to environmental features
and, in some cases, within the flood plain.
