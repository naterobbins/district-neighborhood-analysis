<p>District S8 is one of Austin's largest districts by land area. Including the Oak Hill area, S8 is not considered part of the city's urban core. Therefore, this district has more undeveloped land than other districts within Austin's urban core. Family incomes in this district are also higher than in the urban core and city. There are fewer households making less than $50,000 per year, and more households making over $50,000 per year.

The ethnic makeup of this district is largely white, but the percentage of whites is decreasing, and the percentage of Hispanics is increasing. Single-family housing in S8 took off in the 1970s, and has continued to grow in recent decades. The district is known for its natural beauty and environmental sensitivity, due to its mix of land forms, water features, and habitat, and its connection via the Edwards Aquifer to the Colorado River and Austin’s water supply. Water resources, critical environmental features, environmentally sensitive areas, and natural development constraints create layers of complexity that shape land development here. Water resources in the area include Williamson, Barton, and Slaughter creeks and the Edwards and Trinity Aquifers. The Edwards Aquifer is the most significant water feature in the area. Some parts of the district are not located within the city limits, but are within Austin’s extra territorial jurisdiction (ETJ).
