In terms of land area (not population), this is one of Austin's largest districts. Unlike most districts, S8 is not considered part of the city's urban core. Therefore, this district has more undeveloped land than other districts within Austin's urban core. The rate of population growth in S8 is significantly greater than in the rest of the city. Family incomes in this district are also higher than in the urban core and city. There are fewer households making less than $50,000 per year, and more households making over $50,000 per year.
