West 7 is characterized by a mix of the up and coming neighborhoods of Rosedale, North Loop and the Triangle, along with the established and recognized historic neighborhood of Hyde Park. Hyde Park is a member of the National Historic Registry, as well as a City of Austin NCCD (Neighborhood Conservation Combining District)-- a zoning overlay "intended to preserve and protect older neighborhoods by allowing modifications to applicable regulations in accordance with a neighborhood plan for development and conservation."(Land Development Code, CoA) This has resulted in a marked difference in the built environment between Hyde Park and other parts of this car district. The Rosedale neighborhood, adjacent to Hyde Park, was farm and dairy land in the 1860s and in the 1900s was known for the nurseries and florists in the area. Most of the housing stock in this neighborhood was built during the 1930s and 1940s, although since the neighborhood is not protected by a NCCD or a Neighborhood Plan, many homes are today being remodeled with modern styling. Hyde Park was created as a master planned streetcar-suburb in 1891, far from the core of the city which emphasized large trees, wide sidewalks, for upper class clientele. In contrast to both of these well-established communities, North Loop is often referred to as a neighborhood in "transition" (even 12 years after it the neighborhood plan was implemented). The neighborhood prides itself on a "funky" character, but is becoming increasingly upscale, with homes in the neighborhood selling for as high as $800,000. The entire district is characterized by a large percentage of students, and young professionals affiliated with the University of Texas, especially in the Hyde Park neighborhood, which was rated as one of the "trendiest" neighborhoods in the country by real estate website Trulia.
