<p>District N7 is in East Austin, mostly north of 51st Street and south of 290 East. The Windsor Park neighborhood anchors District N7, which also includes the Capital Plaza shopping center. The US Census bureau estimated its 2015 population at 16,195. The majority of its housing units are renter-occupied.</p>
<p>Property-abatement cases dominate the neighborhood workload in Distict N7, while structure-condition cases comprise the vast majority of multifamily. Structure condition cases are also the majority of commercial cases.

The development of Windsor Park neighborhood began in the 1950s. Previously, the land was primarily used for farmland. Many streets in the neighborhood were former farm roads, including Wheless. Wheless is a major street in the neighborhood that winds through Windsor Park because it formerly bordered the perimeter of area farms. In 1960, construction of the Capital Plaza shopping center (located between IH-35 and Cameron Road) was completed.

As Windsor Park developed in the 1950s, it was considered a growing and active middle class neighborhood. Reagan High School, located just north of Windsor Park, was Austin’s newest high school at the time, opening in Fall 1964. In the 1970s, the federal government targeted the Austin Independent School District for racial segregation. In response, the school board began to bus students between the predominantly African-American Anderson High School in east Austin and Reagan High School. Some residents believe that these school desegregation efforts were one of the major causes of the “white flight” from the area.

The Windsor Park Neighborhood Association formed in 1983 when neighbors organized to protest the proposed closing of the Windsor Park Branch Library. The Association managed to keep the rented library space open and convinced the Austin City Council to build a permanent branch library that opened in July 2000 on Westminster Drive.

A large majority of the housing stock in N7 was built in the 1950s and the 1960s. This district is an established urban area: very little vacant land is available for additional development or preservation as open space. However, extensive changes to impervious cover amounts in the planning area could affect infrastructure needs and may affect drainage and water quality of area creeks.

The ethnicities of residents in the district have shifted significantly over time as well. Many of these residents have since moved out of the area and a more diverse group of people and families have replaced them. The Hispanic population has grown significantly, and Hispanics are now the largest share of the districts population. The presence of a large lower income population in the planning area may be due to the large stock of older housing, which is affordable to these residents. Most multi-family structures in this district are rented; and much of the lower-income population in the district lives in these structures.

Additional residential and commercial redevelopment is anticipated in the planning area, especially along major corridors such as 51st Street and Cameron Road. Tannehill Creek runs parallel to 51st Street and through Bartholomew Park. Erosion mitigation projects including landscaping have recently been completed along the banks of Tannehill Creek. Fort Branch Creek is also a major creek within N7. Tributaries join the main body of Fort Branch Creek near Blanton Elementary. From there the creek flows southeast and crosses Manor Road. In 2000, the City’s Watershed Protection and Development Review Department completed a watershed master plan. The plan indicated that Fort Branch Creek was a priority area for addressing flooding and erosion problems. In 2003, the City replaced bridges over the creek at Manor Road and Westminster Drive to reduce roadway flooding.
