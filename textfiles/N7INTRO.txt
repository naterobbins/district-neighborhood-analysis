The development of Windsor Park neighborhood began in the 1950s. Previously, the land was primarily used for farmland; crops grown in the area included maize, corn, and sorghum. Many streets in the neighborhood were former farm roads, including Wheless. Wheless is a major street in the neighborhood that “jogs” at various angles throughout Windsor Park, because it formerly bordered the perimeter of area farms. In 1960, construction of the Capital Plaza shopping center (located between IH-35 and Cameron Road) was completed.
It was the first major shopping center in the area, predating the Hancock shopping center on the west side of IH-35 (built in 1964). 

As Windsor Park developed in the 1950s, it was considered a growing and active middle class neighborhood. Reagan High School, located just north of Windsor Park, was Austin’s newest high school at the time, opening in Fall 1964. In the 1970s, the federal government targeted the Austin Independent School District for racial segregation. In response, the school board began to bus students between the predominantly African-American Anderson High School in east Austin and Reagan High School.

Some residents believe that these school desegregation efforts were one of the major causes of the “white flight” from the area, which had a profound effect on both the University Hills and Windsor Park neighborhoods that continues today. 

The Windsor Park Neighborhood Association formed in 1983 when neighbors organized to protest the proposed closing of the Windsor Park Branch Library. The Association managed to keep the rented library space open and convinced the Austin City Council to build a permanent branch library, which opened in July 2000 on Westminster Drive.
