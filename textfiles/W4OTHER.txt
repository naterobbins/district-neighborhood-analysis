Like many neighborhood associations, neighborhoods in this district are opposed to direct growth, but rather encouraging growth towards arterials and fighting against infill development. To this effect, the Scofield HOA has an architectural review board, which reviews any proposed property changes (along with city plan inspections) to make sure homes maintain their original character and occupancy rates. Documentation from the neighborhoods associations speak to their desire for keeping neighborhoods quiet and free of the cacophony of streets like Burnet, MoPac and Parmer. To this end, there has been resistance to City of Austin PUDs that look to increase regulation and up-zone certain parts of the district. The city has directed growth efforts towards the Gateway and around the Domain development focusing on Complete Streets, and dense vertical mixed use development to ease demand pressures on established neighborhoods.

Currently, the City is focusing on Burnet Road south of the Gateway to implement a corridor plan that looks to make Burnet Road a “destination street” and focuses on a mix of live/work/play on Burnet Road, rather than merely focusing traffic through the thoroughfare. Eclectic and exciting shops and restaurants along with a few new Mixed Use developments help make the street a destination. 

In terms of complaint density, the directly areas just north and south of Parmer garnered the most Property Abatement cases, and the density of cases diminish moving south, in what is one of the largest contiguously urban districts in the city.
