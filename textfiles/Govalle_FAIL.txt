This was the second attempt in recent years to develop a Neighborhood Plan in this area using a consensus-based, collaborative planning approach. The first effort, that commenced in February, 2000, was suspended due to ongoing disagreements between neighborhood stakeholders, representatives of local businesses, and the City of Austin. In July of 2000 the Cityâ€™s then Planning, Environment and Conservation Services Department (PECSD) suspended staff resources to the Govalle Neighborhood Plan. The City engaged an outside party to facilitate dispute resolution but this was not successful.
