In District N3, property abatement cases comprise the majority of the neighborhood workload. Structure condition cases are the majority of cases for multifamily and commercial cases.

In 2000, NACA foresaw their neighborhoods becoming “inner city neighborhoods” with drive through traffic and congestion. Like other neighborhood planning groups, they are opposed to growth within neighborhoods, directing growth towards Lamar and Rundberg instead. These repercussions of these decisions can be seen in the neighborhood’s current land use as single family neighborhoods are surrounded by multifamily mid-rises and commercial and industrial uses along the main arterials. However, single family homes often have multiple cars parked in the backyard and driveway, which may suggest a large number of residents not accounted for. The neighborhood plan envisions Lamar as a “Great Street”, the precursor to the current “Complete Streets” ordinance. Currently North Lamar through North 3 serves primarily as a major arterial catering to vehicular traffic. The NACA neighborhood plan outlines strict design guidelines that mandate specific roof structures, home facades, and front yard setbacks. This seems to have deterred infill development and new construction in the neighborhood. 

A primary goal of the NACA neighborhood plan is to implement stronger code enforcement and ensure compliance throughout the community. With the expansion of the code department in the last 14 years, there are now two dedicated neighborhood inspectors in the NACA area. (Both NN2 and NN3) Nevertheless, neighborhoods along Rundberg tend to elicit multiple code complaints and illegal activity. The Restore Rundberg initiative strives to empower these communities to become safe neighborhoods with a “community eyes on the street” approach.
